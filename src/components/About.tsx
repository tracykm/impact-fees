      This report presents the results of a detailed survey of impact fees that
      individual jurisdictions across thecountryarecharging.
      Unlikein-kinddeveloperexactions,impactfeesareexpressedindollarsand
      havepublishedfeeschedules,makingiteasytocomparefeeschargedbydifferentjurisdictions.
      The results of the survey describe where impact fees are most common, how
      much jurisdictions in various states are charging, and the types of
      facilities for which fees are being charged. Structure of the Survey
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey that follows this introductory text contains, for each of 270
      jurisdictions, the amount of impact fees (and similar charges) by type of
      facility (roads, water, wastewater, etc.) for five typical land
      usetypes:single-familydetached,multi-family,retail,officeandindustrial.

      The“updated”column gives the date we last verified the fee amounts, not
      the date that the jurisdiction adopted the fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey data is presented in 20 sheets, consisting of four sheets for
      each of the five land use types.

    <p>What Qualifies as an Impact Fee?</p>
    <p>
      The multitude of names used to refer to impact fees is one obstacle to
      developing an accurate survey of such fees. Common terms used to refer to
      impact fees include “capacity fees,” “facility fees,”
      “systemdevelopmentcharges”and“capitalrecoveryfees.”
      Theircommoncharacteristicsarethat(1) they are charged only to new
      development, (2) they are standardized fees as opposed to ad hoc,
      negotiated payments and (3) they are designed and used to fund capital
      improvements needed to serve growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utility Connection Fees. Water and wastewater connection fees that are
      used to fund
      growth-relatedcapitalimprovementsshouldbeclassifiedasimpactfees.
      However,connectionfees often mix impact fee components with service fees
      that cover other types of costs, such as the purchase of a water meter,
      the inspection of the connection, or the administrative cost of
      establishing anewcustomeraccount.
      Inaddition,becausewaterandwastewaterfeesprecededotherkindsof impact fees,
      they are often authorized under separate statutory authority and are often
      more difficult to find. This presents the researcher with a problem.
      Counting only clearly-labeled water and wastewater impact fees is likely
      to under-represent them, but seldom are there sufficient resources to
      interviewlocalofficialstodeterminewhatportionofaconnectionfeeisactuallyanimpactfee.
      For these reasons, it is often useful to look at “non-utility” impact fees
      separately from total impact fees.

      Indeed,somecommunitiesusean impact fee for the construction cost
      component, and combine that with a land dedication/fee-in-lieu
      requirementforthelandcomponent.
      InCalifornia,parkfeesin-lieuoflanddedicationareknownas “Quimby fees,”
      after the name of the 1966 state act authorizing such fees. Because they
      are not labeled as impact fees, land dedication fees-in-lieu are often
      overlooked in impact fee surveys.

      Thisisataxthatonlyappliestonewdevelopment,oftenonapersquarefootbasis,and
      is earmarked for capital improvements. The two can be difficult to
      distinguish. For example, Boulder, Colorado hired consultants to conduct a
      nexus study and adopted an ordinance that had all of the trappings of an
      impact fee ordinance, including earmarking of funds for specific types of
      capital facilities and providing credit against the charges for
      developer-constructed improvements, but

    </p>
    <p>Some Caveats</p>
    <p>
      The results of impact fee surveys can be misinterpreted. This can be
      avoided if the reader keeps the following caveats in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      NotExhaustiveSamples.
      Likemostimpactfeesurveys,thissurveyonlyincludescommunities
      thatchargesomeimpactfees,andexcludesthosethatdonot.
      Thus,an“averageimpactfee”mustbe understood as an average fee for those
      communities that charge impact fees, not as an average for all
      communities.
      AlthoughinCaliforniastatelimitsonlocaltaxingauthorityandrelativelyliberalimpact
      fee enabling legislation have combined to make impact fees virtually
      universal, in most other parts of the country communities that have impact
      fees (other than ubiquitous water and wastewater connection fees) tend to
      be in the minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not Random Samples. Impact fee surveys tend to be opportunistic, and this
      one is no exception. For the most part, the inclusion of a community is
      determined by how readily available the informationis.
      Communitiesthatposttheirfeeschedulesontheirwebsitearemorelikelytobe
      included in a survey than communities that do not. Consultants who compile
      surveys are more likely to include communities that have been clients or
      that are in the same region with former clients, and thisoneisnoexception.
      Forexample,ourfirmcompiledextensivesurveysofimpactfeesinArizona and
      Florida for client communities in those states. For these reasons, the
      fact that a state is not well represented in a national survey does not
      necessarily mean that the state does not have many impact fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      AverageTotalFee,notSumofAverageFees.
      Inthissurvey,averagefeesarepresentedfora varietyofcapitalfacilities.
      Theseaveragesexcludecommunitiesthatarerepresentedinthesurveybut
      donotchargeimpactfeesfortheparticularfacilitytype.
      Onecouldsumtheseaveragefeesbyfacility type, but this “sum of the average
      fees” does not represent the average fee for communities that charge
      impact fees. A more meaningful statistic, and the one reported here, is
      the “average of the total impact fees” charged by all communities
      represented in the survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that a community does not charge a particular impact fee does not
      mean that developers make no contributions to that type of capital
      facility. This is particularly true in the case of roads, because many
      communities without road impact fees require developers to dedicate
      right-of-way and make
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      substantial improvements to abutting roadways as conditions of development
      approval. In communities with road impact fees, developers who are
      required to make in-kind contributions may
      receivecreditagainsttheirimpactfeesforthevalueofthosecontributions.
      Thus,developersmay actually contribute more on average to the cost of
      major road improvements in communities without road impact fees than in
      communities with modest road impact fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactions. Some communities have standard developer exactions that are not
      expressed in dollars. Typical examples are road right-of-way and park and
      school land dedication requirements. We included an estimated cost per
      development unit to represent the value of such required contributions
      whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to broadly-applicable developer exaction requirements, some
      development may also be required or induced to offer other contributions
      toward public capital improvements, such as over-sizing water and
      wastewater lines or making land dedications for roads, parks, or fire
      stations that are not required for all developments. It was not possible
      to assign a standard dollar value per development unit for such ad hoc or
      negotiated exactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unusual Assessment Bases. Most impact fee schedules assess impact fees per
      residential dwelling unit or per 1,000 square feet of nonresidential
      development, and that is reflected in the structure of the survey.
      However,somecommunitiesuseadifferentbasisforatleastsomefees.
      Residentialfees may be assessed based on unit size or number of bedrooms,
      rather than by a flat rate per dwelling unit.
      Utilityfeesaregenerallyassessedbymetersizeformulti-familyandnonresidentialuses.

    <p>
      residential unit size, number of bedrooms, and building densities, and
      these assumptions are

    <p>identified in the land use headings of the survey sheets that follow.</p>
    <p>
      For some communities, published water and wastewater fees were only
      available for a single-family home.
      Inthesecases,wetookadvantageofthefactthatvirtuallyallwaterandwastewaterfeesare
      based on the capacity of the water meter, and there is a relatively
      standard relationship between the smallest meter size that is almost
      always the one used by most single-family homes and the larger meters
      typically used for multi-family and nonresidential development. We assumed
      that a 2” meter
